# Visual Sonar Representation

Visual Sonar Representation is a real-time sonar simulation in pygame demonstrating wave propagation, echo detection, and distance calculation.

The project visualizes how sonar systems estimate distance by measuring the time taken for sound waves to travel to an object and return as echoes.

## How It Works

### Sonar Simulation Logic

- A wave pulse originates from the center point and expands outward
- When the wave reaches a placed target point, an echo wave is triggered
- The system measures:
- Time from emission to contact
    - Time for echo return
    - Distance is calculated using time-of-flight principles and a simulated speed of sound
- Results are displayed in both meters and pixels





### User Interaction

- Click anywhere on screen to place a sonar ping target
- The system automatically detects when the wave intersects the target
- Echo response is visualized in real time
- Distance and time are displayed on the HUD
- Previous measurements are stored in a history log




### Controls

- Mouse Click → Place sonar target
- ESC → Pause menu
- TAB → History / overview panel

  

### Purpose and Learning Goals

This project was built to explore:

- Real-time simulation logic
- Time-based physics modeling
- Pygame rendering and surface management
- Event-driven input handling
- UI overlays and state control
- Audio integration in simulations
- The goal was to create an intuitive visualization of sonar concepts rather than a game.
